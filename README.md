# CMS-Style-Blog-Site

## Description

The purpose of this challenge was to be able to create my first ever Full Stack program. This assignment came with many challenges but through much persistence I was able to finish the program. This site is designed to allow the user to create blog posts's and comment on other users blog posts. The user is also able to edit their blog posts and comments vai their dashboard. I have become way more efficient with front-end to back-end development and I have a much greater understanding of many node package modules. I learned how to efficiently set-up package.jsons and how to test all the routes via insomnia. I ran into many bugs that helped deepend my understanding of Full Stack development.
